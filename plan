1️⃣ Throughput baseline (iperf3) + profiling cpu
PodIP → PodIP DONE
Same-node vs cross-node DONE
Jumbo vs standard MTU how to change MTU
📌 Output: max Gbps

2️⃣ Latency & stability (Fortio)
Run uncapped (-qps 0) Fortio with large payloads.
Measure:
p50 / p99 latency
error rate
achieved RPS
Compare:
PodIP vs Service
Policy on vs off
eBPF on vs off
📌 Output: latency curves + error %
